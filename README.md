# Cars sales listings Data Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Car Sales Listings Data Analysis project! This repository presents an in-depth analysis of car sales listings data, uniquely obtained through web scraping techniques. We meticulously collected data from a prominent car sales listings website, capturing details from 300 distinct car listings. This process involved transforming 300 dictionaries into a structured dataset, rich with diverse car specifications and features.

The aim of this project is to dive into the intricacies of the automotive market, uncovering trends and preferences in car sales listings through detailed data analysis and visualization techniques. Our work here focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the data, which was carefully curated to provide a comprehensive view of consumer behavior and market trends in the car industry.

We invite you to explore the notebooks, data files, and insights documented in this repository, which highlight the findings and methodologies of our analysis. This project stands as a testament to the power of combining sophisticated web scraping techniques with robust data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics.
